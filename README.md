This repository provides the official implementation of the paper:

> **Realigning Quantum Architecture Search with a Top-k Focused Training Paradim**  
> (Submission to npj Quantum Information)

We introduce a new training paradigm for Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) centered on a differentiable, top-heavy ranking loss. This approach directly aligns the model's training with the primary goal of QAS: identifying a small set of elite, top-performing quantum circuits, rather than perfectly ranking all candidates. Our framework is enabled by a novel DAG-Transformer model and a self-supervised pre-training strategy, establishing a more effective and purpose-driven method for discovering optimal quantum architectures.

üìö Built upon [TensorCircuit](https://tensorcircuit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## üß© Key Features

- **Directly optimizes a differentiable, top-heavy ranking loss** to focus the model on identifying elite circuits.
- **Proposes a shift from standard correlation metrics** (like Kendall's Tau) to top-heavy metrics (like NDCG) for more practical and relevant evaluation of QAS rankers.
- **Introduces a DAG-Transformer architecture** with a novel Reachability-based Attention mechanism tailored for the causal structure of quantum circuits.
- **Employs a self-supervised pre-training strategy** to learn robust circuit representations from unlabeled data.

## üöÄ Example Usage

### 1. Generate Candidate Circuits

Generate candidate quantum circuits for different tasks and construct datasets by computing the corresponding ground-state energies.

Run the following script file„ÄÇ

```bash
sampling.sh
```

```bash
VQETrainer.sh
```

- `sampling.sh` samples quantum circuits.
- `VQETrainer.sh` computes the ground-state energy of quantum circuits.

### 2. Compute Relative Fluctuation (RF) Proxy

Compute the RF metric using a large number of unlabeled quantum circuits.

```bash
RF_proxy_calculator.sh
```

Relative Fluctuation (RF)[2] is a training-free metric that predicts the learnability of a Quantum Neural Network (QNN). It compares the fluctuation of a QNN‚Äôs training landscape with a standard learnable one, identifying issues such as low expressibility, barren plateaus, bad local minima, and overparameterization.

### 3. Pre-training & Fine-tuning Predictor

Pre-training and fine-tuning predictor models designed for quantum circuit evaluation.

```bash
run_experiments.sh
```

---

### 4. Architecture Search Phase

Perform quantum architecture search using the trained predictor to efficiently explore candidate quantum circuits and identify high-performance architectures.

```bash
QAS_run_experiments.sh
```
